# Klarna Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Klarna (Klarna Bank AB)

* Incorporated in 2005, in Stolckholm Sweden

* Founded by Sebastian Siemiatkowski (CEO), Niklas Adalberth (Deputy CEO and Board Member), and Victor Jacobsson (Left the company in 2012, retained 10% stake in the company)


* The three founders first brought the idea to the public in a startup competition held at the Stockholm School of Economics in 2005, in front of audience members such as the King of Sweden and H&M’s chairman Stefan Persson. Unfortunately, their idea of “buy now, pay later” was not popular amongst the crowd and they finished dead last. Committed to the idea, they did not let this get them down. The founders recalled a conversation with a man who encouraged them, saying “the banks will never do it”, and they encourage this man to step forward and receive recognition for his short, but powerful words. From this they went on to start the company and never looked back!

* Klarna has been funded through various rounds of private investing, totaling in $3.7 billion to date. Specific investments include: 

    - $125.3 m from Sequoia Capital, Atomico, General Atlantic, and more in 2014

    - $250 m from Permira in 2017

    - An unspecified amount from Snoop Dogg in 2019



## Business Activities:

* Klarna is giving consumers more options when they go to pay for their products. Lots of people might not have the necessary cash at hand to pay for a product that they need at a specific moment. But, they know that they will have paychecks coming in consistently and will be able to pay small chunks of the total cost of this item when the checks do come in. Klarna gives them that option. Klarna also offers other services, including regular loans and a single use credit card. 

* The intended customer for Klarna is someone who loves to shop online, but might not have a ton of cash on hand, may have poor credit history, or they have low limits on their credit cards.

* Klarna holds only 1.43% of the market, but that just means they have lots of room to grow

    - The market size is really just growing and growing. Anyone with access to the internet and that purchases items with a card is an available customer. Klarna holds only 1.43% of the market globally, but in the US it soares to 18%. It seems that Klarna is one of the only companies in the space that have yet to partner up with a industry giant. For example, Square has purchased Afterpay (2.71% combined marketshare), Amazon and Apple have partnered with Affirm (.46%), and PayPal has launched its one product (47.73%). 
    
    - Klarna offers more flexible payment solutions compared to others. While Afterpay only allows one way to pay (four biweekly payments over the span of six weeks), Klarna gives options of  four biweekly payments; you can choose not to pay for 30 days; or you can finance a purchase over six to 36 months. Klarna also offers the ghost card, a one-time credit card where the customer gets pre approved for a specific amount, then can use the card at any website that allows prepaid cards. The customer can then use the ‘pay later’ feature on the specific amount they charge on the card, but the card and associated numbers are only valid for one purchase. This enables the use of Klarna and their services on websites that do not offer Klarna.
